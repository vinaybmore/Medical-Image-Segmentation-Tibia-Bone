Medical Image Segmentation of Tibia Bone Using U-Net

Osteoarthritis is the most common degenerative disease characterized by cartilage loss and is one of the major causes of pain and disability in individual adults. It is the most common form of arthritis in the knee. Many diagnostic applications critically depend on the successful localization of bone structure. Multiple researches and experiments have been conducted to understand Osteoarthritis pathophysiology and natural history however, there are still marked controversies. The etiology of Osteoarthritis includes joint damage, aging, exercise, gender and ethnicity, diet, bone density, and genetics. In this project, we train a machine learning model (a convolutional neural network called U-Net) to perform bone segmentation on 3D knee magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The goal of this study is to develop a method that can automatically detect the bone area from a knee MRI image by training a model to segment the tibia bone.
